# LearningTimeMeasurement
## Console program that counts time spent on learning. <br />
If you want to have some statistics about spending time on anyting you like; go on and use my code! :P <br />
**Here are commands that are currently implemented:** <br />
- *Start* (start counting)<br />
- *Actual* (show actual statistics)<br />
- *Break* (temporary stops counting)<br />
- *Continue* (continue counting after break)<br />
- *End* (stop counting, save statistics to file and terminate program)<br />
- *Help* (show available commands)<br/>

Personally i find it useful to have some statistics about learning because it's motivating me to work even more! :P :shipit:
